# Automated-Notetaking

## **Welcome to AutoCherry** :rocket:

:smile:**Intro** :smile:\
A little about me. I am Mayank Rahalkar, a recent cybersecurity graduate. I have a deep interest in learning new technolgoies and I plan to build my career in pentesting. This is my first project on GitHub. I have no coding experience and most of the codes on my GitHub would be generated from ChatGPT. I am looking to solve small problems that I am facing in daily life.

:tired_face:**Challenge I faced** :tired_face:\
I used to run a bunch on commands on terminal and there were times when I used to forget noting the results of the commands down in my note taking application Cherry Tree. This happened a lot of times and then I had to scroll up the terminal and find out the result I wanted. I asked a few people some time ago if there was a way in which we could redirect the output to a node in Cherry Tree, but nobody had any answer to it. As I am not a coder, I didn't have the necessary skills to develop something like this. 

:smiley:**So, Who can use AutoCherry?** :smiley:\
Are you into IT and feel like note taking is a hassle for you?
Do you sometimes forget to take notes of the commands you have run on the terminal?
If your answer is "YES", then you have come at the right place.

:smiley:**What does it do?** :smiley:\
AutoCherry is a simple python script which is just at the beginning phase of development. The script accepts asks the user to input the file name. This name would be the file name for the CherryTree file. The user will have to enter the full path. The script then asks the user to input the command to run. Upon hitting enter, it asks the user for "node" name. This is the name of the node that will be created in the CherryTree file. Upon hitting enter, the command executes and the result is displayed on the terminal as well it gets saved in the CherryTree node. The script then asks the user if another command needs to be run. If the user enters "Y", the loop continues, else the script terminates.

:page_with_curl:**Initial Release: March 6th, 2023**:page_with_curl:\
As of March 6th, 2023, the script cannot do much and hasn't been tested with a lot of commands. Currently, I have tested it with just the ping and nmap command. 

**Future Updates** :dart:\
I plan to improvise the script even more. I want the script to run for all commands. Further ahead, I am planning to add a screenshot functionality which would take a screenshot of the terminal and can be used as a Proof-of-Concept. Also, I will be adding a functionality where if the script terminates, it will ask the user again if he needs to modify an existing file.

**Feedback Appreciated** :memo:\
I would really like if some gave me a feedback and would help me in improvising the script even more.
